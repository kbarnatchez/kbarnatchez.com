<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic raging for roughly half a year now, numerous institutions have worked together to make daily, state-level data on cases and deaths available to the public. Among the many useful tools that are easily accessed include JHU’s coronavirus dashboard and Worldometer’s COVID tracker. As impressive as these efforts have been, the data available only paint part of the picture. The issue with cases is intuitive: people are less likely to get a test if they don’t feel sick (even if they really are carrying the virus), so reported cases likely underestimate the true value. The issue with deaths is both more important to understand and more complicated: there are competing sources of causes behind any death: complications due to COVID, causes excluding COVID, and causes that are indirectly influenced by COVID (e.g. forgoing a heart surgery to avoid the hospital/due to lack of insurance because of a job layoff and then suffering a cardiac arrest).</p>

<h3>Putting excess deaths measures in context</h3>
<p>It can be hard to interpret excess deaths totals by themselves. If we let <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> denote the number cumulative number of excess (non-COVID) and observed (COVID) deaths, then the ratio <span class="math inline">\(\frac{E_i}{D_i}\)</span> gives us a sense of how large that state’s count of excess deaths is relative to its count of COVID deaths. For states with</p>

<h3>Working with the CDC excess deaths data</h3>
<p>The CDC’s excess deaths data is readily available to download, along with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">page</a> outlining their methodology. In the code below, I pull the data directly from the CDC’s API and start cleaning it</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load in main data
datalink = &#39;https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&amp;bom=true&amp;format=true%20target=&#39;
data&lt;-read.csv(datalink,sep=&#39;,&#39;)

# Data for all deaths 
data_all&lt;-data[data$Outcome == &#39;All causes&#39;,]
data_all&lt;-data_all[data_all$Type != &#39;Unweighted&#39;,]

colnames(data_all)[1] &lt;- &#39;date&#39; # correct character issue in data var</code></pre>
<p>For context, it makes sense to examine “typical” trends in excess deaths measures for a couple states:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data=data_all[data_all$State==&#39;Massachusetts&#39;,],
        aes(y=Excess.Higher.Estimate,x=as.Date(date))) +
        geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, fill=&#39;steelblue&#39;) +
        xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;CDC Excess Deaths Estimate, All Causes&quot;) + 
        ggtitle(&quot;CDC Excess Deaths Estimates, Massachusetts&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data=data_all[data_all$State==&#39;Texas&#39;,],
        aes(y=Excess.Higher.Estimate,x=as.Date(date))) +
        geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, fill=&#39;steelblue&#39;) +
        xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) + ylab(&quot;CDC Excess Deaths Estimate, All Causes&quot;) + 
        ggtitle(&quot;CDC Excess Deaths Estimates, Texas&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It’s useful to consider both cross-sectional and dynamic features of the data. One metric to consider is the cumulative number of deaths within each state through the present, as this gives us a sense of how serious of a toll the virus has had on each state.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Keep data from the start of 2020 onward
data&lt;-data[as.Date(data[,1])&gt;=as.Date(&#39;2020-01-01&#39;),]
data_all&lt;-data_all[as.Date(data_all$date)&gt;=as.Date(&#39;2020-01-01&#39;),]

# Data for all deaths excluding covid
data_ex_covid&lt;-data[data$Outcome == &#39;All causes, excluding COVID-19&#39;,]

# Create running sums of deaths and excess deaths
covid_deaths&lt;-data_all$Observed.Number - data_ex_covid$Observed.Number
data_all$cum_covid_deaths &lt;- ave(covid_deaths,data_all$State,FUN=cumsum)
data_all$cum_excess &lt;- ave(data_all$Excess.Higher.Estimate,data_all$State,FUN=cumsum)
data_all$excess_ratio &lt;- data_all$cum_excess/data_all$cum_covid_deaths

# 
deaths_curr &lt;- data_all[as.Date(data_all$date)==as.Date(&#39;2020-08-015&#39;),]
deaths_curr &lt;- deaths_curr[deaths_curr$State != &#39;United States&#39;,]
deaths_curr &lt;- deaths_curr[!is.na(deaths_curr$excess_ratio),]</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can plot each state’s excess death ratio against its cumulative COVID death count to get a sense of</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Partition data to label only a subset of points
deaths_curr_label &lt;- deaths_curr[deaths_curr$cum_covid_deaths&gt;10000 | deaths_curr$excess_ratio&gt;5,]
deaths_curr_nolabel &lt;- deaths_curr[deaths_curr$cum_covid_deaths&lt;=10000 &amp; deaths_curr$excess_ratio&lt;=5,]

ggplot(deaths_curr_label, aes(x=cum_covid_deaths,y=excess_ratio)) + 
       geom_point(size=3,alpha=1,color=&#39;red&#39;) +
       geom_label_repel(aes(label=State)) +
       geom_point(data = deaths_curr_nolabel, color=&#39;steelblue&#39;,size=3,alpha=1) +
       ggtitle(&#39;States with low COVID death tolls have suspiciously high excess death estimates&#39;) +
       xlab(&#39;Cumulative covid deaths through 08-15-2020&#39;) +
       ylab(&#39;Ratio of CDC excess deaths to cumulative COVID deaths&#39;) +
       labs(caption = &#39;Excess deaths are estimated by the CDC. New York state data excludes New York City, which is reported separately.&#39;) +
