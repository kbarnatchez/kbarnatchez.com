<blockquote>
<p>You’re a contestant on the hit new game show, “You Bet Your Fife.” On the show, a random real number (i.e., decimals are allowed) is chosen between 0 and 100. Your job is to guess a value that is less than this randomly chosen number. Your reward for winning is a novelty fife that is valued precisely at your guess. For example, if the number is 75 and you guess 5, you’d win a 5 dollar fife, but if you’d guessed 60, you’d win a 60 dollar fife. Meanwhile, a guess of 80 would win you nothing.</p>
<p>What number should you guess to maximize the average value of your fifing winnings?</p>

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>First, we’ll approximate the solution via simulation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nsim &lt;- 1e5
rewards &lt;- rep(NaN,100)

for (n in 1:100) { # loop over (discrete) guesses
  cumreward &lt;- 0
  for (s in 1:nsim) { # loop through simulated rewards
    if (n &lt; 100*runif(1)) {
      cumreward &lt;- cumreward+n
    }
  } # for s 
  rewards[n] &lt;- cumreward/nsim 
} # for n</code></pre>
<p>After storing the results, we can plot the average reward over time:

<h2>Analytic approach</h2>
<p>Let’s represent our rewards from playing the game by the random variable <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> denote our choice of number between 0 and 100. We care about the conditional distribution of rewards for a given number, <span class="math inline">\(p(r|n)\)</span>. This is a discrete distribution, as there are only two possibilities: win <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\frac{n}{100}\)</span>, and nothing with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{100}\)</span>. In turn, we can write out the conditional expectation of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}(r|n) = n\left(1-\frac{n}{100}\right) + 0 \times \frac{n}{100} =  n-\frac{n^2}{100}
\]</span>
We want to choose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to maximize this expression:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}(r|n)}{\partial n}=0 &amp; \iff 1-\frac{n}{50}=0 \\
&amp; \iff n=50
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
