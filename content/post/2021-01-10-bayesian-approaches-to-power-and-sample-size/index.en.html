<p>Last post, we looked at classical methods for estimating sample sizes required to achieve a desired power. While these approaches tend to be intuitive and easy to implement, they rely on the typically unrealistic assumption that we know the mean and variance of our effect of interest before conducting the study. One way to circumvent this issue is to take a Bayesian approach, which allows us to incorporate uncertainty into our beliefs about the effect size.</p>
<p>There are multiple</p>
<div id="prior-simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Prior simulation</h3>
<p>With the prior simulation approach—a bit of a Bayesian-frequentist hybrid—we treat either the experiment’s power or its desired sample size as an unknown quantity while holding the other fixed. Then, by simulating numerous draws from our prior distributions, we are able to obtain distributions over our quantities of interest – rather than reporting a single sample size, we are able to report a range that incorporates our uncertainty about the underlying effect size.</p>
<p>First things first, we need to put priors on our parameters of interest. We’ll assume <span class="math inline">\(x|\mu,\sigma \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu \sim N(\mu_0,\sigma_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)\)</span>. From here, the procedure is straightforward. Let’s consider the procedure when fixing the desired power:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> from the specified prior distributions. This requires fixing any hyperparameters.</li>
<li>With your fixed values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and drawn values of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, determine the required sample size to achieve a power of <span class="math inline">\(1-\beta\)</span> using a frequentest framework. My previous post outlines how to do this for superiority tests of mean treatment effects.</li>
<li>Record the calculated sample size and repeat steps 1 and 2. Do this for a large amount of iterations (at least 1,000).</li>
</ol>
<p>This process will leave you with a series of recorded sample sizes that can be analyzed.</p>
<div id="example" class="section level4">
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="r"><code># Fixed values
mu0 &lt;- 3
alpha&lt;- 0.01
beta &lt;- 0.2
E&lt;- 10000 # number of episodes

# Hyperparameters
mean_mu &lt;- 5
gamma1 &lt;- 8
gamma2 &lt;- 2

calc_n &lt;- function(sigma,mu,mu0,alpha,beta) {
  n &lt;- ceiling( ( sigma* (qnorm(1-beta) + qnorm(1-alpha)) / (mu-mu0)    )^2  )
  return(n)
}</code></pre>
<p>From here, we just need to repeatedly draw values from our prior distributions and record the calculated sample sizes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>simulate_studies &lt;- function(alpha,beta,E,mu0,mean_mu,gamma1,gamma2) {
  nvals &lt;- rep(NaN,E)
  for (e in 1:E) {
    tempsig &lt;- rgamma(1,shape=gamma1,rate=gamma2)
    tempmu  &lt;- rnorm(1,mean=mean_mu,sd=1)
    
    nvals[e] &lt;- calc_n(tempsig,tempmu,mu0,alpha,beta)
  }
 return(nvals) 
}

nvals &lt;- simulate_studies(alpha,beta,E,mu0,mean_mu,gamma1,gamma2)
nvals&lt;- nvals[nvals&lt;quantile(nvals,0.95)]</code></pre>
<p>This leaves us with a distribution of simulated sample sizes that we can visualize:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_df &lt;- data.frame(nvals)

ggplot(plot_df,
       aes(x = nvals)) +
       geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;,bins = 50) +
       labs(x=&#39;Required N&#39;,
            y=&#39;Frequency&#39;,
            title=&#39;Distribution of required sample size&#39;,
            subtitle=&#39;&#39;) +
       theme_bw() +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;)) </code></pre>
