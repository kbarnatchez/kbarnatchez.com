I'm a second year biostatistics PhD student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a student researcher at Massachusetts General Hopsital. I'm interested in 1) developing statistical methods that address common challenges in causal inference, and 2) developing decision-support tools for clinicians. 

I  value the clear communication of statistical concepts and results, and  (when motivated) occasionally [write about](https://keithbarnatchez.netlify.app/post/) various topics in biostatistics and economics.
